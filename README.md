# My NVIM Setup

This is my nvim setup which was built from source, adding each configuration, options, mappings and plugins manually
rather than using flavors. Why? Well so this way I have more control on nvim's behaviour and it'll work exactly how I
need.

## Dependencies

Here are what you need to install locally, in order to have it working properly:
- nvim;
- ninja-build;
- gettext;
- cmake;
- curl;
- ripgrep (it's a Telescope dependecy);
